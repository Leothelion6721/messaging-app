## 🔥 TESTING ON MULTIPLE DEVICES

Want to chat from your phone or another computer?

### Step 1: Find your computer's IP address
Open Command Prompt and type:
```cmd
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" - it will look like: `192.168.1.100`

### Step 2: Start the server
Double-click `START.bat`

### Step 3: On your phone/other device
Make sure you're on the **same WiFi network**, then open browser and go to:
```
http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000
```
Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`

## ❌ TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Node.js is NOT installed"
→ Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org
→ Restart your computer
→ Run START.bat again

### "Port 3000 is already in use"
→ Close any other programs using port 3000
→ Or change the port in server.js (line 11):
```javascript
const PORT = 5000; // Change to any number
```

### START.bat doesn't work
→ Right-click START.bat
→ Click "Run as Administrator"

### "npm is not recognized"
→ Node.js is not installed correctly
→ Reinstall Node.js
→ Make sure to check "Add to PATH" during installation

## 🎯 WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN

When everything works:
1. ✅ Black window opens with green text
2. ✅ Says "SERVER IS STARTING"
3. ✅ Shows "http://localhost:3000"
4. ✅ Browser opens the app
5. ✅ You can login and chat
6. ✅ Messages appear instantly in other tabs!

## 💡 TIPS

- **Keep the black window (Command Prompt) open** while using the app
- Press `Ctrl + C` in the Command Prompt to stop the server
- You can have unlimited users chatting simultaneously
- Messages are stored on the server (lost when you close the server)
- For permanent storage, you'd need to add a database

2. **Add features** like group chats, file sharing, etc.
3. **Customize** the colors and design
